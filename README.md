9/8: Took about two weeks but finally finished this project. Hardest part by far was figuring out how to target the boxes to change the coloring. It'd almost be embarassing if I did a daily update on what I did because I had to go back and change how the grid was created about 3 times. I got the closest with using a table but then I wasn't able to contain it to the specific height I wanted.

Glad it's done though!
